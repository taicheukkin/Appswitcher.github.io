        <h1>AppSwitcher Privacy Policy & Data Deletion Guide</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 24, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to AppSwitcher (hereinafter referred to as "the App"). This App is developed by L'Sky (hereinafter
            referred to as "we", "us", or "our") to provide a floating window for quickly switching between
            applications. We value your privacy and want to clearly explain how we collect, use, and protect your data.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Information You Provide Voluntarily</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purchase Credentials</strong>: When you subscribe to the App via Google Play, we process the
                purchase token, order ID, and product ID provided by Google Play to verify subscription validity and
                expiration. We do not store your credit card or payment card information.</li>
            <li><strong>Obfuscated User ID</strong>: To identify your subscription status, we generate a locally stored
                obfuscated ID (obfuscatedAccountId) using SHA‑256. This ID is associated with your device but cannot be
                traced back to your personal identity. It is transmitted to our server to link subscription records.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Installed App List</strong>: After you grant permission, we read the list of installed
                applications (including app names and package names) on your device so you can select which apps to
                include in the switcher. This data is stored only locally and is never uploaded to our server.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Logs and Diagnostics</strong>: When the app crashes or encounters an error, we collect
                device model, OS version, app version, error stack traces, and crash time via <strong>Firebase
                    Crashlytics</strong>. This information helps us fix issues and improve stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Error Events</strong>: Certain critical business errors (e.g., subscription verification
                failures) are reported to our own server through our <strong>ErrorReporter</strong> module. This
                includes error codes, messages, and basic device information (such as Android version) to monitor
                service health.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Status</strong>: Firebase Crashlytics may collect connection type (Wi‑Fi / mobile data)
                to analyze crash contexts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 Information Collected by Third‑Party SDKs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Billing Library</strong>: Used to handle subscription purchases. It collects
                purchase tokens, order IDs, and subscription status. For details, see <a
                    href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong>: Used for crash reporting. It may collect device identifiers
                (e.g., Android ID), crash logs, and diagnostic information. See the <a
                    href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a> for
                more.</li>
            <li><strong>OkHttp / Retrofit</strong>: Used to communicate with our server for subscription verification
                and error logging. All connections are encrypted via HTTPS.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide core functionality: quickly switch between apps based on your selected list.</li>
            <li>Process subscriptions: verify purchases, manage subscription status (including the 18‑day free trial),
                and prevent fraud.</li>
            <li>Improve the app: analyze crashes and errors to optimize user experience.</li>
            <li>Customer support: if you contact us by email, we may use the information you provide to assist you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Information Sharing</h2>
        <p>We share your information only in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google</strong>: Necessary information (such as purchase tokens, crash logs) is shared with
                Google through Google Play Billing and Firebase Crashlytics.</li>
            <li><strong>Our own servers</strong>: Subscription verification requests and error logs are transmitted to
                our servers (located in Hong Kong) for the purposes stated above.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal requirements</strong>: We may disclose information if required by law or in response to
                valid requests by public authorities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to any third party for marketing purposes.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Locally stored data</strong>: Your selected app list and preferences are stored only on your
                device. You can delete this information by clearing app data or uninstalling the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Server subscription records</strong>: Subscription data associated with your obfuscated ID
                (e.g., purchase tokens, expiry dates, subscription status) is retained while your subscription is
                active. If you cancel your subscription or request deletion, we will delete or anonymize these records
                within 30 days. However, transaction records (e.g., order IDs) may need to be retained for 5 years for
                tax and anti‑fraud purposes, and will no longer be used for any other purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash logs</strong>: Logs collected via Firebase Crashlytics are automatically deleted after 90
                days. Error logs on our own servers are also anonymized after 90 days.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access and Deletion</strong>: You can request access to or deletion of your personal data stored
                on our servers by emailing us (see below). Note that certain transaction records may be retained as
                required by law.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage Permissions</strong>: You can manage floating window permission and app list access
                through your device’s Settings → Apps → AppSwitcher → Permissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Stop Using</strong>: You can stop all data collection by uninstalling the app. Local data will
                be removed, and server data will be handled according to the retention policy above, unless you make a
                separate deletion request.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>This app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information
            from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will
            delete it immediately.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through
            an in‑app notice or upon the next release. We encourage you to review this page periodically for the latest
            information.</p>

        <hr>

        <h1 id="data-deletion">Data Deletion Request Guide</h1>
        <p>Under applicable laws (such as GDPR, CCPA), you have the right to request the deletion of your personal data
            stored by us. Because the app does not offer traditional user accounts, please follow these steps to make a
            request:</p>

        <h2>Step 1: Prepare Information</h2>
        <p>To help us locate your data quickly, please gather the following (if available):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Obfuscated User ID</strong>: This ID is generated locally by the app. You can contact us for
                assistance in retrieving it (it may be found in app logs or through debugging).</li>
            <li><strong>The approximate date you first used the app</strong> (e.g., month and year).</li>
            <li><strong>The last time you subscribed or used the app</strong> (optional, but helpful).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 2: Send an Email</h2>
        <p>Send the above information to the following email address:</p>
        <p class="email">project01hk@gmail.com</p>
        <p>Please use the subject line: <strong>"Data Deletion Request - AppSwitcher"</strong> and clearly state that
            you want your personal data deleted.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Processing Timeline</h2>
        <p>We will process your request within <strong>30 days</strong> of receipt and confirm the deletion by email. If
            we need to extend this period (e.g., due to complexity), we will notify you.</p>

        <h2>Scope of Deletion and Exceptions</h2>
        <p>We will delete the following data associated with you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Obfuscated user ID and linked subscription records (including active/expired/trial status).</li>
            <li>Error logs stored on our servers that contain your specific ID.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, the following data may be retained due to legal or compliance reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transaction records</strong>: Purchase tokens, order IDs, and transaction times related to
                Google Play billing may need to be retained for 5 years for tax and anti‑fraud purposes, and will be
                anonymized (no longer linked to your obfuscated ID).</li>
            <li><strong>Crashlytics logs</strong>: Logs collected by Firebase are automatically deleted after 90 days
                according to their policy; we cannot manually delete them early, but they do not contain direct personal
                identifiers.</li>
        </ul>
